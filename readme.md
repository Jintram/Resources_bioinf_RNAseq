# Overview of some resources.

For our studies, mouse and human transcription factors and ligand-receptor pairs are very relevant.
I have gathered the following resources now:
### 1. Human TFs

There are two options I considered;

- From [Han et al, TRRUST v2: An expanded reference database of human and mouse transcriptional regulatory interactions. Nucleic Acids Res. 2018;46(D1):D380-D386](http://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1013), which was cited ±900X. Link: https://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/downloadnetwork.php (human).
- From [Lambert et al. The Human Transcription Factors. Cell. 2018;172(4):650-665.](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.029), which was cited ±1600X.

### 2. Mouse TFs

- Also from [Han et al, TRRUST v2: An expanded reference database of human and mouse transcriptional regulatory interactions. Nucleic Acids Res. 2018;46(D1):D380-D386](http://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1013), this is both human and mouse. Link: https://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/downloadnetwork.php (human).

### 3. Ligand-Receptor interactions human

From Ramilowski, J. A., Goldberg, T., Harshbarger, J., Kloppman, E., Lizio, M., Satagopam, V. P., … Forrest, A. R. R. (2015). 

### 4. Ligand-receptor interactions mouse

Converted from above human data of Ramilowski et al., similar as to what Skelly et al. did. See: Skelly DA, Squiers GT, McLellan MA, Bolisetty MT, Robson P, Rosenthal NA, Pinto AR. Single-Cell Transcriptional Profiling Reveals Cellular Diversity and Intercommunication in the Mouse Heart. Cell Rep. 2018;22(3):600-610. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.12.072
